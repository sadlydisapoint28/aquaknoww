/**
 * HERO SEARCH FUNCTIONALITY
 *
 * Purpose: Provides real-time fish search in the hero section
 *
 * How it works:
 * 1. User types in search input
 * 2. Function filters fish database by name or scientific name
 * 3. Shows matching suggestions in dropdown
 * 4. Handles "no results found" cases
 * 5. Provides clear button to reset search
 *
 * Features:
 * - Case-insensitive search
 * - Searches both common and scientific names
 * - Real-time suggestions
 * - Click to view fish details
 * - Responsive design
